Hi Cursor Agent!

I need your help testing our ZoomInfo MCP integration. Please follow the instructions in:

ðŸ“„ docs/CURSOR_TESTING_GUIDE.md

This guide has 7 specific tasks to test the ZoomInfo connector and understand what data we can access.

Your goal:
1. Test ZoomInfo MCP searches for real estate company contacts
2. Document the exact data structure we receive
3. Fill out docs/ZOOMINFO_TEST_RESULTS.md with your findings

Focus on:
- Finding executives at Greystar (real estate company)
- Understanding what contact/company data fields are available
- Documenting JSON structures
- Identifying rate limits and quotas

This will help us build the REST API integration correctly.

Please start with Task 1 (verifying connection) and work through all 7 tasks systematically.

Thanks!
